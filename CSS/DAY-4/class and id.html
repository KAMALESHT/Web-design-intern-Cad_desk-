    This is the first class on css
    <marquee><h>**Class and id** </h1></marquee> 
    <p>In this we are going to see about class and id which seems similar but but the major
        difference is we can have multiple class in single element  but we can have only 
        single id in single element

    <h1 class="a b">test for class property</h1>
    <h1 id="a b">test for id property</h1>
